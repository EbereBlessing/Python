# 100 Days of Python Challenge - Day 1  Band Name Generator
# This is the first challenge: Band Name Generator. The program will ask the user for the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet. It then combines these two inputs to suggest a potential band name.

print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.\n")
# Get inputs from the user
name = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What is your Pet Name?\n")
# Generate and display the band name
print(f'Your Brand Name could be {name} {pet}')
